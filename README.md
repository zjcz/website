# Personal Website

## Introduction
My personal website. Very work in progress.

I have been planning to create a portfolio website for the last few years and have had a few false starts.  In the end I decided to just do something quick and unexciting, just to get the project done and out there.  In time I am sure it will evolve.
## Design Choices
I decided to keep the tech stack to a minimum on this project, so built it using just plain HTML and Javascript, no libraries or frameworks.  I used Bulma for the CSS though, otherwise it would have been mid 2050 by the time I got the styling right ðŸ˜‰.  I had originally planned to use Tailwind CSS but gave up as the learning curve was too steep and I wanted to get this finished so I could concentrate on portfolio projects.  Bulma seemed an easy step to make with my previous experience in Bootstrap (although now Bootstrap have dropped jQuery perhaps I could have used that...)

## Future Plans
I intend to update the Portfolio section shortly, once I have finished some of my many planned side projects.

I would also like to add a blog to the site, preferably using a static site generator to keep the hosting options simple.
